I am a postdoctoral researcher in cosmology working in the [ByoPiC](https://byopic.eu) group at Universite Paris-Saclay. I work mainly on understanding the non-linearities of the large-scale structures of our Universe. My primary research interests are the `redshift space distortions' (RSD) effect, and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect.
